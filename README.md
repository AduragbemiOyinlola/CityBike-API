# **CITY BIKE API**

## **ABOUT PROJECT**



This repository contains my final project for the 3MTT program.

The City Bike API is a project that provides bike-sharing data for apps, research, and projects to use. To date Citybikes supports more than 400 cities and the Citybikes API is the most widely used dataset for building bike-sharing transportation projects.

I used this API to get information about bike-sharing networks across the globe and put the data obtained from the API into a suitable form for analysis. I then went ahead and looked into a particular bike-sharing network to get information about the stations, and bikes... of the network.
